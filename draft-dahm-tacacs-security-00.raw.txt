                          TACACS+ TLS Support
                       draft-dahm-tacacs-security

Abstract

   The TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] provides device
   administration for routers, network access servers and other
   networked computing devices via one or more centralized servers.
   This document, a companion to TACACS+ protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs], adds Transport Layer Security (TLS
   [RFC8446]) support and deprecates former inferior security
   mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   The TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] provides device
   administration for routers, network access servers and other
   networked computing devices via one or more centralized servers.  The
   protocol carries authentication, authorization and accounting
   information for TACACS+ clients.  While this information is highly
   sensitive, TACACS+ lacks modern and/or effective privacy, integrity,
   and authentication of the connection and network traffic between the
   server and client.

   The existing privacy, integrity, and authentication mechanisms of
   TACACS+ are extremely weak.  The Security Considerations section of
   TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] adequately describes this
   and will not be repeated.

   To address these flaws, this document updates the TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] to support TLS [RFC8446] authentication and
   encryption, and deprecates the use of its former mechanisms.

2.  Technical Definitions

   The Technical Definitions section of TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] is fully applicable here and will not be
   repeated.

   Peer

   This refers to a Server or a Client.

4.  Deprecation of TACACS+ PSK and Encryption

   The original TACACS+ draft specified a form of encryption and Peer
   authentication using a pre-shared key that is wholly inadequate by
   modern standards and is diminutively referred to as data obfuscation
   in TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].  The introduction of
   TLS PSK and certificate Peer authentication and TLS encryption to
   TACACS+ obsolesces these former mechanisms and so are hereby
   deprecated.  Along with them, the TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG flag in
   the TACACS+ header, the least significant bit (LSB) of the flags
   field, is also deprecated.

   Peers compliant with this document and using TLS should set the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG flag in the Packet header.  A Peer that
   receives a Packet without the flag set, should immediately terminate
   the TCP connection.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document improves the privacy, integrity, and authentication of
   the connection and network traffic between the TACACS+ servers and
   clients by adding TLS support.  This does not in itself protect the
   server nor clients; the operator and equipment vendors have a role.
   That role is to diligently follow current best practices for
   maintaining the integrity of network devices and selection of TLS key
   and encryption algorithms.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new well-known TCP port number fore
   "tacacss", described as "TACACS over TLS/SSL".
