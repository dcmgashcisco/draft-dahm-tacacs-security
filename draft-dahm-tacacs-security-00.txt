1.  Introduction

   The TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] provides device
   administration for routers, network access servers and other
   networked computing devices via one or more centralized servers.  The
   protocol carries authentication, authorization and accounting
   information for TACACS+ clients.  While this information is highly
   sensitive, TACACS+ lacks modern and/or effective privacy, integrity,
   and authentication of the connection and network traffic between the
   server and client.

Internet-Draft                 TACACS+ TLS                     June 2019


   The existing privacy, integrity, and authentication mechanisms of
   TACACS+ are extremely weak.  The Security Considerations section of
   TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] adequately describes this
   and will not be repeated.

   To address these flaws, this document updates the TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] to support TLS [RFC8446] authentication and
   encryption, and deprecates the use of its former mechanisms.

2.  Technical Definitions

   The Technical Definitions section of TACACS+ Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] is fully applicable here and will not be
   repeated.  The following terms are also used in this document.

   Peer

   This refers to a TACACS+ Server or Client.

   Session

   Defined in TACACS+ [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs] as a single
   authentication sequence, a single authorization exchange, or a single
   accounting exchange.

3.  TLS for TACACS+

   TACACS+ connections are over TCP/IP, initiated by the Client to the
   Server.  The well-known TCP/IP port 49 on the Server is used for
   unencrypted and encrypted connections as defined in TACACS+
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].  A connection may be used for only a single
   Session or the multiplexing of multiple Sessions.

   It is mandatory to maintain the privacy, integrity, and
   authentication of these connections, as RFC3365 [RFC3365] dictates
   the need for end-to-end security.  The current IETF technology best
   suited for TACACS+ is TLS, which can provide both authentication and
   transport encryption.

3.1.  Well-Known TCP/IP Port

   All data exchanged by TACACS+ Peers MUST be encrypted, including the
   authentication of the Peers.  Therefore, encryption MUST be initiated
   immediately upon the establishment of the TCP/IP connection.  For
   this reason, it is desirable to not use a "STARTTLS" command process
   that is a feature of some protocols, that once existed without TLS,
   use to maintain backward compatibility.  Instead, a different well-
   known TCP/IP port is assigned, port [TBD].

Internet-Draft                 TACACS+ TLS                     June 2019


   A new port is considered appropriate and superior to "STARTTLS"
   because:

   o  easily block the unencrypted/inferiorly encrypted version by the
      port number,

   o  a passive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can watch the
      unencrypted version,

   o  STARTTLS can be vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks,

   o  and can help prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive
      information due to misconfiguration.

3.2.  TLS Protocol Version

   TACACS+ implementations supporting TLS encryption MUST implement at
   least TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246].  They SHOULD implement TLS version
   1.3 [RFC8446].  They MAY implement higher TLS versions.

3.3.  Cypher Requirements

   TACACS+ Servers supporting TLS MUST utilise the TLS encryption
   options described in the following sections.  XXX but should be
   allowed to evolve as TLS does.

3.3.1.  Mandatory Cipher Suites

   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] allows specifying application profiles prescribing
   which cipher suites to implement for interoperability purposes.  To
   maintain simplicity of current TACACS+ configuration using pre-shared
   secrets, the server implementation MUST implement:

   o  TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

   o  TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

   o  TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

   A Client MUST implement at least one of the cipher suites which are
   implemented on the Server, and MAY implement all of them.

   Both Clients and Servers MAY implement other cipher suites, but their
   interoperability is not guaranteed and their implementation is
   outside of scope of this document.  XXX again; should allow a way to
   evolve.  how???

3.4.  Deprecation of MD5 and unencrypted

3.5.  Authentication

   XXX

3.5.1.  PSK Identity Requirements

   Because determining a correct PSK value on the server side is a
   computationally intensive operation requiring multiple round trips, a
   mechanism for hitless key change must be defined.  During TLS
   handshake, a client MUST use PSK identity as defined in RFC 4279
   [RFC4279] to signal to the server which PSK value to use.  If server
   does not recognize PSK identity it MUST respond with decrypt_error
   alert and MUST NOT respond with unknown_psk_identity.  Process to
   change pre-shared keys on server and client is then: 1.  Add new key
   with new PSK identity on the server.  2.  Add new key with new PSK
   identity on the client.  3.  Remove old key with old PSK identity
   from the client.  4.  Remove old key with old PSK identity from the
   server.  Note: PSK identity is transmitted in clear text and must not
   contain information which could aid an attacker who can eavesdrop on
   the connection.

3.5.2.  TLS Certificate Identity Requirements

   XXX

4.  Deprecation of TACACS+ PSK and Encryption

   The original TACACS+ draft specified a form of encryption and Peer
   authentication using a pre-shared key that is wholly inadequate by
   modern standards and is diminutively referred to as data obfuscation
   in TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].  The introduction of
   TLS PSK and certificate Peer authentication and TLS encryption to
   TACACS+ obsolesces these former mechanisms and so are hereby
   deprecated.  Along with them, the TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG flag in
   the TACACS+ header, the least significant bit (LSB) of the flags
   field, is also deprecated.

   Peers compliant with this document and using TLS should set the
   TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG flag in the Packet header, indicating that
   the data obfuscation is not used.  A Peer that receives a Packet
   without the flag set, should immediately terminate the TCP/IP
   connection.

   A Client that is compliant with this document MUST NOT utilize these
   deprecated authentication or encryption methods with a Server that is

   also compliant.  A TACACS+ implementation MAY, and is encouraged to,
   offer a configuration mechanism to disable them.

   A future document SHOULD be written to deprecate the well-known TCP/
   IP port 49, allocated by TACACS+ Protocol [I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document improves the privacy, integrity, and authentication of
   the connection and network traffic between the TACACS+ servers and
   clients by adding TLS support.  This does not in itself protect the
   server nor clients; the operator and equipment vendors have a role.
   That role is to diligently follow current best practices for
   maintaining the integrity of network devices and selection of TLS key
   and encryption algorithms.

   It is not and never will be reasonable to expect RFCs be updated in
   perpetuity as each new TLS version and/or algorithm emerges nor at a
   rate to keep pace.  It would be highly desirable for the TLS working
   group to publish a document that evolves with TLS and its algorithms
   that RFCs could reference without the need to update those RFCs, thus
   allowing them to evolve by inheritance.  As no such document exists,
   implementers and operators SHOULD make informed use of RFCs to
   determine which TLS versions and algorithms should be supported or
   deprecated, in the absence of updates to this RFC.

   TLS encryption SHOULD be used in deployments when both the clients
   and servers support it.  Servers that support TLS encryption MAY be
   configured to allow legacy encryption when TLS encryption is not
   supported by the client.

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to deploy TACACS+ without transport or legacy
   encryption, except for test environments.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The authors request that, when this draft is accepted by the working
   group, the OPSAWG Chairs submit a request to IANA for an early
   allocation, per RFC402 [RFC4020], of a new well-known system TCP/IP
   port number for "tacacss", described as "TACACS+ over TLS/SSL".  The
   name "tacacss" follows the common practice of appending an "s" to the
   name given to the non-TLS well-known port.

   RFC EDITOR: this port number should be replace "[TBD]" within this
   document.
