        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
		The <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref> provides device administration for routers, network access servers and other networked computing devices via one or more centralized servers.
		The protocol provides authentication, authorization and accounting services for TACACS+ clients.
            </t>
            <t>
		While the content of the protocol is highly sensitive, TACACS+ lacks modern and/or effective confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the connection and network traffic between the server and client.
		The existing mechanisms of TACACS+ are extremely weak and the Security Considerations section of the <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref> adequately describes this.
            </t>
            <t>
		To address these deficiencies, this document updates the <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref> to use <xref target="RFC5246">TLS 1.2</xref> and <xref target="RFC8446">TLS 1.3</xref> authentication and encryption, and deprecates the use of its former mechanisms.
            </t>
            <t>
		To support SSH authentication using public keys, highly desired by the operator community, this document introduces a method to support sending public keys to a TACACS+ client, allowing centralized management.
            </t>
            <t>
		To accomplish these goals and improve security and functionality when a network proxy is involved in a TACACS+ connection, new and uniform packet formats are introduced.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Technical Definitions">
            <t>
		The Technical Definitions section of the <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref> is fully applicable here and will not be repeated, though may be augmented.
	 	The following terms are also used in this document.
            </t>
            <section title="Unsecure Connection">
            <t>
		This is another term for a Connection as defined in <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref>.
		It is a Connection without TLS and therefore being plaintext or possibly using unsecure TACACS+ authentication and obfuscation.
            </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Peer">
            <t>
		This refers to a TACACS+ Server or Client.
            </t>
            </section>
            <section title="TLS Connection">
            <t>
		A TLS Connection is a TCP/IP connection with TLS authentication and encryption used by TACACS+ for transport, similar to a Connection as defined in <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref>.
            </t>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section title="TLS for TACACS+">
            <t>
		TACACS+ connections are TCP/IP connections initiated by the Client to the Server.
		The well-known TCP/IP port 49 on the Server is used for unencrypted and encrypted connections as defined in the <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref>.
		A connection may be used for only a single Session or the multiplexing of multiple Sessions.
            </t>
            <t>
		It is mandatory to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of these connections, as <xref target="RFC3365"></xref> dictates the need for end-to-end security.
		The current IETF technology best suited for TACACS+ is TLS, which can provide both authentication and transport encryption.
            </t>
            <section title="Well-Known TCP/IP Port">
	    <t>
		All data exchanged by TACACS+ Peers MUST be encrypted, including the authentication of the Peers.
		Therefore, encryption MUST be initiated immediately upon the establishment of the TCP/IP connection.
		For this reason, it is desirable not to use a "STARTTLS" command process, a feature that some protocols, which once existed without TLS, use to maintain backward compatibility.
		Instead, following <xref target="RFC7605"></xref>, a different well-known system TCP/IP port is assigned by IANA, port [TBD], for the TLS connection.
	    </t>
            </section>
	    <section title="TLS Protocol Version" anchor="TLSProtoVers">
            <t>
XXX rfc8773 is required to have server/client certificates with PSK
		TACACS+ implementations supporting TLS MUST implement at least <xref target="RFC8446">TLS version 1.3</xref> until it is deprecated.
		However, implementations SHOULD also implement newer TLS versions as they emerge and MUST abandon TLS versions as they are deprecated, including TLS 1.3 and prior versions.
            </t>
            <t>
		Clearly deprecation is more difficult for Servers, because support for and deployment of new TLS versions to Clients will occur with great randomness or perhaps not at all due to End of Support (EoS).
		Therefore, it is of great value to, and implementations MAY, support deprecated versions to allow for gradual adoption and software at its End of Life (EoL).
		A Server that supports deprecated versions SHOULD NOT enable this support except by operator configuration.
            </t>
            </section>
	    <section title="Cipher Requirements">
            <t>
XXX The IANA registry now has "Recommended" algorithms.  reference this for ciphers that should be supported.
		As with <xref target="TLSProtoVers">TLS Protocol Versions</xref>, TACACS+ implementations MUST adopt and deprecate new cipher suites as they emerge or fade and MAY support deprecated cipher suites.
		However, cipher suites is a far more complex subject because those chosen directly affect the effectiveness of the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of TLS, the processing required, and the types of authentication available.
            </t>
            <t>
		TACACS+ Servers supporting TLS MUST utilize the TLS encryption options described in the following sections.

XXX but should be allowed to evolve as TLS does.

            </t>
		<section title="Mandatory Cipher Suites">
		<t>
		<xref target="RFC5246">TLS 1.2</xref> allows specifying application profiles prescribing which cipher suites to implement for interoperability purposes.
		To maintain simplicity of current TACACS+ configuration using pre-shared secrets, the server implementation MUST implement:
		<list style="symbols">
		<t>TLS-DHE-PSK-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256</t>
		<t>TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA</t>
		<t>TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA</t>
		</list>
		</t>
		<t>
		A Client MUST implement at least one of the cipher suites which are implemented on the Server, and MAY implement all of them.
		</t>
		<t>
		Both Clients and Servers MAY implement other cipher suites, but their interoperability is not guaranteed and their implementation is outside of scope of this document.
		XXX again; should allow a way to evolve.  how???
XXX russ housley says:
	Section 3.3.1: Do you want to provide any guidance for TLS 1.3?  I would say something like:

        if TLS 1.2 is used, then one of the following ciphersuites MUST be used
	...

        if TLS 1.3 is used, then one of the following ciphersuites MUST be used
	...

	This is not ideal for the evolution part, but you might say:

        if a version beyond TLS 1.3 is used, then one of the ciphersuites that i
s marked as "Recommended" MUST be used ...

            </section>

	    <section title="Authentication">
            <t>
XXX
TLS authentication can occur via asymmetric cryptography or
 Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm,
or various forms of symmetric pre-shared-key (PSK).
we only consider out of band PSK.  KDF hash algorithm needs to be specified?  PSK can only be assoc with one HKDF in tls1.3
RPKs - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7250

            </t>
		<section title="PSK Identity Requirements">
		<t>

See rfc 8446 s2.2 regarding PSK  secret choice

Because determining a correct PSK value on the server side is a computationally intensive operation requiring multiple round trips, a mechanism for hitless key change must be defined.
During TLS handshake, a client MUST use PSK identity as defined in <xref target="RFC4279"/> to signal to the server which PSK value to use.
If server does not recognize PSK identity it MUST respond with decrypt_error alert and MUST NOT respond with unknown_psk_identity.
</t>
<t>
Process to change pre-shared keys on server and client is then:
<list style="format %d">
<t>Add new key with new PSK identity on the server.</t>
<t>Add new key with new PSK identity on the client.</t>
<t>Remove old key with old PSK identity from the client.</t>
<t>Remove old key with old PSK identity from the server.</t>
</list>
XXX reference "key life" in rfc8645 ???
</t>
<t>
Note: PSK identity is transmitted in clear text and must not contain information which could aid an attacker who can eavesdrop on the connection.

        <section title="Deprecation of TACACS+ PSK and Encryption">
            <t>
		The <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref> specified a form of encryption and Peer authentication using a pre-shared key that is wholly inadequate by modern standards and is diminutively referred to as data obfuscation.
		The introduction of TLS PSK and certificate Peer authentication and TLS encryption to TACACS+ obsolesces these former mechanisms and so are hereby deprecated.
            </t>
            <t>
		Along with them, the TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG flag in the TACACS+ header, the least significant bit (LSB) of the flags field, is also deprecated.
		Peers compliant with this document should set the TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG flag in the Packet Header of packets on TLS Connections, indicating that the data obfuscation is not used.
		A Peer that receives a Packet without the flag set on a TLS Connection, should immediately log the error and terminate the TCP/IP connection.
            </t>
            <t>
		A Client that is compliant with this document MUST NOT utilize these deprecated authentication or encryption methods on TLS Connections/
            </t>
            <t>
		A TACACS+ Server or Client implementation SHOULD, and is strongly encouraged to, offer a configuration mechanism to disable non-TLS connections entirely.
            </t>
            <t>
		A future document SHOULD be written to deprecate the well-known TCP/IP port 49, allocated by the <xref target="RFC8907">TACACS+ Protocol</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="TACACS+ Extended Authentication Packet Types">
            <t>
                Versions 1 and 2 of the TACACS+ Protocol, as defined in <xref target="RFC8907"></xref>, specify the TACACS+ Authentication Packets for START, REPLY and CONTINUE which support the credential validation use case but does not accommodate any further arguments which may be used to give context to the request.
            </t>
            <t>
                One use-case where this shortcoming inhibits correct operation is for the TACACS+ proxy.
                Because the originating client is not encoded in the regular Authentication START Packet, TACACS+ Servers generally attempt to determine the client from the TCP connection.
                This is effective only for the first step: proxied TACACS+ servers can no longer securely enforce policy based upon the end client IP-Address.
            </t>
            <t>
                Further, advanced use cases (such as SSH key distribution) would otherwise rely on embedding structured information into the single data fields, obfuscating the content of the protocol.
            </t>
            <t>
                To support these use cases, and allow clients to add environment information to the request, the Extended Authentication Packets brings the Authentication phase of the protocol inline with the Authorization and Accounting Phase by incorporating extensible arguments.
            </t>
            <t>
                The server should expect Extended Authentication Packet Bodies if the minor version in the Packet Header is: 0x2

            <section title="TLS">
                <t>
		    This document improves the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the connection and network traffic between the TACACS+ Peers by adding TLS support.
		    This does not in itself protect the server nor clients; the operator and equipment vendors have a role.
		    That role is to diligently follow current best practices for maintaining the integrity of network devices and selection of TLS key and encryption algorithms.
                </t>
                <section title="TLS Options">
	        <t>
		    It is not and never will be reasonable to expect RFCs be updated in perpetuity as each new TLS version and/or algorithm emerges nor at a rate to keep pace.
		    It would be highly desirable for the TLS working group to publish a single document, that evolves with TLS and its algorithms, which RFCs using TLS, such as this one, could reference without the need to update those RFCs, thus allowing them to evolve by inheritance.
		    As no such document exists, implementers and operators SHOULD make informed use of RFCs to determine which TLS versions and algorithms should be supported, deprecated, or abandoned, in the absence of updates to this RFC.
                </t>
                </section>
                <section title="TLS Use">
                <t>
		    TLS encryption SHOULD be used in deployments when both the clients and servers support it.
		    Servers that support TLS encryption MAY be configured to allow Unsecure Connections when TLS encryption is not supported by the client, but this is NOT RECOMMENDED because of the threat of downgrade attacks, as described in <xref target="wellknown"/>.
		    Unsecure Connections would be better served by separate Servers from the TLS Servers.
	        </t>
	        <t>
		    It is NOT RECOMMENDED to deploy TACACS+ without TLS authentication and encryption, except for test and debug environments.
	        </t>
                </section>
            </section>
            <section title="Well-Known TCP/IP Port" anchor="wellknown">
	        <t>
		    A new port is considered appropriate and superior to a "STARTTLS" command because it allows:
		    <list style="symbols">
		    <t>ease of blocking the unencrypted or inferiorly encrypted connections by the TCP/IP port number,</t>
		    <t>passive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) monitoring the unencrypted version to be unaffected by the introduction of TLS,</t>
		    <t>avoidance of Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks that can interfere with STARTTLS,</t>
		    <t>and helps prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive information due to misconfiguration.</t>
		    </list>
	        </t>
	        <t>
		    However, co-existence of inferior authentication and encryption, whether an Unsecure Connection or deprecated parts that compose TLS, also presents opportunity for down-grade attacks.
		    Causing failure of connections to the TLS-enabled service or the negotiation of shared algorithm support are two such down-grade attacks.
		    The simplest way to address the exposure from Unsecure Connection methods is to refuse Unsecure Connections at the server entirely, perhaps using separate servers for Unsecure Connections and TLS.
		    Another approach is mutual configuration that requires TLS.
		    Clients and servers SHOULD support configuration that requires Peers, globally and individually, use TLS.
		    Furthermore, Peers SHOULD be configurable to limit offered or recognized TLS versions and algorithms to those recommended by standards bodies and implementers.
	        </t>
	        <t>
		    Servers and clients could also maintain a cache of Peers that have engaged in TACACS+ TLS connections and demand TLS from that point forward.
		    However, this has potential to be a Denial of Service (DoS) vector, whereby an attacker causes a sever to believe that a client that does not support TLS has successfully connected with TLS.

        <section title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
		The authors request that, when this draft is accepted by the working group, the OPSAWG Chairs submit a request to IANA for an early allocation, per <xref target="RFC4020"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6335">RFC6335</xref>, of a new well-known system TCP/IP port number for "tacacss", described as "TACACS+ over TLS".
		The name "tacacss" follows the common practice of appending an "s" to the name given to the non-TLS well-known port.
		This allocation is justified in <xref target="wellknown"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
		RFC EDITOR: this port number should replace "[TBD]" within this document.
