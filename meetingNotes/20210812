 - I think that I'd like to move S5 to S3, followed by SSH pubkeys, then
      TLS.  If Douglas is actively editing S5, we should wait until he is
      done to avoid unpleasant merging.

   Douglas> I'm happy for that move.

   we decided take the order tls, extended packets, ssh, deprecation.  This
   has been done.

- regarding referencing rfc8097 vs duplicating; douglas has converted the
  extended packet format text to references.  More may be needed to the
  rest of the doc when we review.

- We'd talked about deprecating MS-CHAP v1,
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-CHAP ?  anything else.  MD4 support,
      used primarily by MS-CHAP (rfc2433, 2759)?

  We decided that we must review 8097 and for other deprecation and ensure
  md4 deprecation can be done without side-effects.
