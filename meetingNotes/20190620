- draft progress
	We have an outline and there has been some useful private comment from
	IETF security folks.  Heasley will summarize this for the group asap
	and start to form the TLS specific portion of the draft.

- progress on living document reference
	Including Housley's comments about this, there was discussion about
	living (evergreen) document reference for cipher suites.

	Doug suggessts that we must be careful about the document taking
	responsibility for security specifics, but that it assume some by
	(or in) specifying recommended ciphersuites.

	Thorsten agrees to take security/ciphersuits into our hands, but
	could also reference other document's recommendation AND take
	REQUIRED ciphersuites from those documents.

	Doug clarifies that he is agrees, but wants to recognize that tacacs
	rfc will then require updates in the future.  OK, but has impact.

- email to OPSAWG about tacacs+ TLS
	Doug and Thorsten agreed that the draft email was reasonable.

	Andrej should tell us if he agrees.  Heasley will wait for Andrej
	then send to the OPSAWG list.

- what is the sate of the current draft.
	doug has had no time due to travel.  he will try to find time this
	weekend.  has made a list of comments from the emails.

	Thorsten suggests splitting the emails among the group for parallel
	progress drafting responses.

The next call will be Tuseday 2nd of July at 10:00 PT, 18:00 Dublin time.
WebEx invitation has been sent.
