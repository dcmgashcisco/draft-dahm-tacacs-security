- joe emailed 2 weeks ago about the TACACS draft.
	- douglas has created a diff and ought to be submitting that soon.
	  hopefully the last set of changes.
 
	- we think that douglas has it under control - but should ask us if
	  there is anything that we can help.
 
	- we should return more earnestly to the TLS work after this
 
- there has been tacacs yang draft discussion on the ietf list.  not sure that
  it has any effect on the tacacs draft.
