1) Thinking about the proxy case, we want to formalize a way that a device
   could set a flag/field to keep the original requester address in the packet.

   DeKok said that RADIUS (can?) embed the NAS info in a request

   Maybe use the remote address field?  There were several options mentioned in
   a previous meeting; see 20190509 notes.

2) We may want to interconnect the 3 A's, so authorization knows that
   authentication has happened, and a device can retrieve information from a
   server.  It can then put into an authorization request as an optional
   attribute.

   Perhaps use an Auth Token, possibly o-auth or o-auth-like?  However,
	- then all tacacs servers must share these tokens, or
	- a Token could retain information about the server that created it and
	  that server would become preferred for the given login/ppp/etc
	  session, but a method of re-authentication to another server would
	  still be needed and anycast tacacs servers might complicate this, or
	- the authentication may need to be performed multiple times.

3) We do need separate (well-known) TCP port number

4) We want to use PSK and Certs but need to find more information again on
   what were the arguments pro and con for the two options

   Someone warned against using Certs due to complexity.  Who was that and
   what exactly were the reasons?

5) Plan to create one document with all updates.

6) Action Item for everyone: pick what you want to deprecate from the
   current document, put it into Github

   - should the current tacacs "encryption" mechanism be deprecated?
	- This would break tacacs for many old devices that are still servicable
   - should MD4 support, used primarily by MS-CHAP (rfc2433, 2759), be
     deprecated?  MS-CHAPv1 can probably be dropped.
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-CHAP

7) items besides TLS to add.
   - method for ssh pubkey support.  See 20190402 notes.
