- doug hasnt had much time for tacacs and will probably be wrapped-up in the
  tacacs draft comments/responses for some time.

- heasley will take the item to investigate the living document pointer
  question from the previous meeting WRT TLS key/cyrpt algorithms.

- heasley will take the item to craft a message to OPSWG describing our
  intention WRT TLS and solicit comment.  And, begin a draft for TLS
  support.

  - doug noted, "For TLS, past comments indicated that we can not just rely
    upon PSK, it must also support PKI."

- Doug is OOT for next two weeks;  expecting the next call in roughly 3 weeks
  time.
