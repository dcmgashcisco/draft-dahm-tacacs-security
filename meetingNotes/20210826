- Would prefer issues not be in the doc (XXXs).  decided to try issues system
  in github.

- Douglas asks whether splitting the ssh pubkey retrieval process and the
  authentication process with pubkeys would solve the unconventional process
  of step 7 in the current draft.  And, whether it would be useful in general
  to have these separately.

	- Authentication would be able to proceed without keys being sent,
	  such as if keys were locally configured or I (heasley) suppose,
	  as I write the notes, that the client could have cached keys.

	  - Would caching be negative, security wise?  it would mean that
	    keys could not be immediately revoked.  tacacs could have a
	    cache timer for keys; 0 seconds == no caching.

- There was a discussion about disambiguating users in a credential-less
  environment.  If there is no pubkey exchange, what is the assurance that
  the useer has been authenticated?  The conclusion was that the same issue
  exists for authorization and accounting.

- Maybe we should comment about preference of locally-configured keys?

- Thorsten, I believe, suggested we try to avoid ops-specific issues with
  client configuration.  I think this was in referece to the previous note
  about key location.
