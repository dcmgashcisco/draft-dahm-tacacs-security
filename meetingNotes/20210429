- Douglas asks if 1.3 PSK requires certs; Heasley believes it does, at least for
  the sever side, because PSK in 1.3 is really session resumption that is only
  possible after a full exchange has occured.  We agreed to research this
  further.

  We *think* that PSKs are desired for ease of use & ease of deployment and
  possibly for operation in isolation.  We think that certificates might be
  a barrier to use, because certificates is complex and not universally
  understood.  However, to argue for certificates in isolation, it is possible
  load the CA's public key onto and cache it on devices to allow for the full
  cert check - even if it is a self-signed (by T+ servers) cert.  The
  complicated part is the loading itself AND maintaining all of these artifacts.

  Douglas suggested that it would be useful to look into how radius did DTLS/TLS
  in rfc6614.

  Doug offered these research resources:

  TLS 1.3
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446

  Deprecating TLS 1.0, 1.1
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8996

  RADIUS Radsec
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6614

- ssh
  netconf notifications rfc5277 show how notifications work.  the NMS connects
  to the device and subscribes to notifications.  netconf transport 
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4741#section-2.2 states required transports
  (ssh and tls).

  rfc6470 is the base notification spec for notifs.

  rfc6241 is netconf 1.1 (i think)

  But this is what I was thinking of:
  rfc8071 is netconf call-home, where the device connects to the NMS; wherein
  the designation of which is the server and which the client does not change,
  nor does behavior of noftifications - meaning that the client (NMS) must
  initiate the notification subscription.

  At Thorsten's suggestion (i think), we concluded that we might explore this,
  but will not suggest it to the WG unless a PSK model is demanded and PSK in
  TLS 1.3 is considered too difficult.

- Doug will review/coalesce the protocol changes from the emails (subject
  "New Packets" and "T+ Proxy") for inclusion in the draft.

- we would like to have a first draft in ~4 weeks, which may not be complete.
  It should have a security section, even if it is basic.  Doug prefers to
  omit the xml tagging until we are nearly ready to submit.
