- TLS via STARTTLS, separate well-known TCP port, or both
	- All vote for a separate port.  A summary of intent should be sent to
	  the WG and develop a document from there.
	- should allow PSKs and certificates for client authentication
		- certification server authenication too?
	- list of mandatory ciphers, optional, extended
		- must say something, but be future proof.  are living docs
		  an adopted concept.  Doug will enquire

- communication of real tacacs client address to the real tacacs server, with
  an active middleman (firewall or proxy)
	- AVPs could be used for authorization & accounting, but authentication
	  does not have AVPs
		- adding AVPs to authenication could be exploited for other
		  uses and be more universal within tacacs, or
	- a client address could be added to the tacacs header, or
	- a client address could be added to each tacacs packet type, or
	- can rem_addr be exploited to include the original client, by
	  adding a separator in the field.  eg:
	  "original rem_addr field/client address"
		- Andrej feels that altering an existing field adds potential
		  for error (and security holes)

	- how should this protocol change be introduced?
		- a new proto version, or
		- a header packet type
	  It is felt that this needs more thought; a topic for the next call.

- SSH pubkey idea
	- pushed to the next call

- document approach; there is agreement to:
	- drive TLS as a separate document
	- drive other enhancements or deprecation in another
	- finally, coelesce these into one cohesive document

- Next call May 23 at 18:00 IST/10:00 PDT on Doug's Webex
