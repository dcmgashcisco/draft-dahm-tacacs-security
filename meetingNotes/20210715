- Douglas asks why rfcs 6614 & 5425 make no mention of certificate revocation?
  we wonder if this is simply a feature of TLS and does not require mention?
  ISTR that RBush or RHousley suggested revocation is needed, possibly in
  particular for resumption tickets?

- should we limit ourselves to PSK and therefore tls1.2?  will the WG require
  certificates?

- should we mention 1.3 and PSK?  definitely 1.2 + PSK, but maybe say that
  1.3 + PSK can be used when it is stable.

  Thorsten suggests [implementations] SHOULD support PSK (1.2 or 1.3) and
  MUST support Certs.  To which there is agreement.

  We will try to avoid specifying a TLS version.

- Douglas suggests splitting the TLS section to CERT-related text and other
  TLS text.  Heasley will make an attempt that the full document and pass the
  pen to Douglas/Thorsten.
