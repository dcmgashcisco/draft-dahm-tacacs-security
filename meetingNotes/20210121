- discussion about Douglas' email from Nov 26 about adding the NAS address
  to authentication requests.

  Concluded that we should persue option 2 from that email; add a new version
  with new packet types for authen, author, accounting, improving consistency
  and extensibility.  And,
        - extend argument lengths to 4 bytes (from 1)
        - also extend arg count fields to 4 bytes (from 1)
 
  Douglas will draft proposed packet formats.
 
- discussion about how to incorporate ssh pubkey authen into tacacs.  Heasley 
  asked about how the server could offer the keys to the client (so that the
  server does not need to handle signature comparison and/or handle the crypto
  algorithms) and how should the client indicate to the server success/failure
  of the pubkey auth.
 
  A typical authen is something like: 
        Server                  Client
                        <<<<    authen start (may include username)
        get username    >>>>
                        <<<<    username
        get password    >>>>
                        <<<<    password
        pass/fail       >>>>
                        EOF
 
  Could the server send pubkeys as <data> in the authen_reply packet (S5.2)
  as status GETDATA or GETPASS or a new status?  This flow seems very odd.
  And, the result still needs to be communicated to the server.
 
  Further discussion is moved to the maillist.
